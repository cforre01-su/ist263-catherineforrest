Catherine ForrestWeek 02IST263Weeks 02 of IST 263 had HTML as the main topic. Not just what HTML is and its mechanics, but what role it plays in making a webpage. HTML a general markup language, it’s content that is rendered by a web browser. We went over the components such as tags, elements, attributes, and document type. Once we got through the general information, we looked at how to structure our HTML code and the guidelines to writing it properly to avoid errors. The most beneficial lesson of this week was walking through out to create the about-me.html page, then practicing how to use the tags 'html', 'head' ,'title', 'body' , and 'h1' and what they caused to output. Being able to walk through it with the professor, being able to ask questions first hand. I good question for an exam would be when it is appropriate to use blank lines and indentation.
