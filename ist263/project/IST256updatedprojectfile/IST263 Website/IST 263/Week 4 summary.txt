Catherine ForrestWeek 04 IST26302/10/20The focus of our fourth week in IST263 was the introduction of CSS. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML.  With CSS we are able to miniplate fonts, colors, values and units, backgrounds, block/inline elements, and create a box model. We learned the purpose of using a font-family, and how to apply custom fonts to our code. We are able to use colors within our code by using either HEX or RGB colors, these color types which we can then apply to fonts, background, borders, etc. It is also really important to have an understanding of values and units, such as pixels (px), width (%) or width in (em). The utilization of units and values allows us to very precisely miniplate the size of a font, border, block/inline element, and many other features of CSS. A block element forms a visible block on the page where you can then place text or images, block elements also cause a line break to occur. An inline element will format text within an inline block that is directly formatted around the text, you cannot put block elements inside inline elements. A potential test question could be:  “Describe the Box Model” Answer: the content of the box is where images appear, then this is surrounded by transparent padding which clears the area around the content, then a border goes around the padding and content, and then there is a transparent margin which clears an area outside the border.
