      The website I have decided to design and develop is a website concerning my sorority chapter. This will be an informational website for the sorority Sigma Delta Tau, a website being something that my sorority chapter doesn’t have but could seriously benefit from. My sorority, in particular, doesn’t have a main source of information that is easy to find and access, thus creating a website that provides this information is seriously useful. The first page will provide general information such as, who we are, house values, information about Sigma Delta Tau Nationals, national and chapter history, address, and contact info. The second page will display an image with a bio below it for each of the girls in the house who currently hold executive positions in the form of text blocks within a list ie: president, vice president, secretary, risk manager, treasurer, scholarship chair, panel delegate, philanthropy chair, new member educator, recruitment chair, social chair, and assistants. The final page is going to be the philanthropy information page, detailing the non-profit organizations we support ie. Prevent Child Abuse America, and Jewish women’s International, and the events that we have to raise funds such as EAT PIE and BESDT in the Bakery. All SDT chapter content is available for use while following copyrights for all SDT national content. All images, videos, and multimedia will come directly from the Syracuse Sigma Delta Tau chapter.
