Week 05


For Week 05 we were taught about website structure and planning, and CSS selectors. Concerning website structure and planning, we were introduced to the project lifecycle stages. The analysis stages purpose is to examine the overall purpose of the site and to analyze feasibility. The specifications stage serves to refine project goals and conduct thorough analysis. The design stage is where you create a prototype. The implementation stage is when you develop a functional site with content and graphics. Then the test/launch stage comes into play, where you test the sites functionality making sure it operates correctly and is user friendly. Finally, the maintenance stage, is when you track the websites functionality and update SEO. We then moved onto learning how wireframes help with UI design and document functionality, and also online tools that we can use to make our own wireframes for the project. In relation to wireframes we were taught about the implications of the “F” pattern, ie. where to systematically place the most important information so when the user’s eyes scan the page their eyes are drawn to the most important/ engaging information. In our second class of the week, we were taught about CSS selectors such as: type selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. We then reviewed what semantic html is and its importance to better understand non-semantic elements such as DIV (block level elements) and SPAN (inline elements). A good potential exam question could be: “Which of the following are non-semantic elements?” Answer: DIV and SPAN.
