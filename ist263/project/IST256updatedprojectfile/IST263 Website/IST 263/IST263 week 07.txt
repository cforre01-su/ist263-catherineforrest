The first class of IST263 week 07, all students took the blackboard midterm exam. The exam consisted of 24 questions pulled from the banks of weekly summary questions students have been submitting. There were both a mix of multiple choice and fill in the blank questions. During the second class of week 07 we learned about layouts in CSS. We went over the 5 elements of HTML such as the header, nav, aside, main, article, section, and footer. This was some prep for the homework due that Saturday. Then we learned about the grid system. A standard web page width is usually 960px or 1200px, being a 12-grid column. We then had grid system combinations explained to us. After going over the slides we moved on to working through the beginning of the homework with Professor Talley. Having Professor Talley there to guide us through the basic layout really helped students get a better understanding and a jumpstart on the way to approach the homework.
