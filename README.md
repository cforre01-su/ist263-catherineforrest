Week 03
IST263

In our third week of IST263 we went more in-depth about HTML tags. We went over the difference between unordered lists and ordered lists, and which type should be used when. For the first time we worked with the HTML table tags. An HTML table is defined with the <table> tag, we define each row with the <tr> tag, the table header is defined by the <th> tag, and a data table is defined with the <td> tag. Then we were taught about HTML links. HTML links are hyperlinks which are used to jump from one document to another. External links can be referenced with a URL or with a path relative to the current web page. We use the <a> tag to define a link, the href attribute to define the link address. At the end of the first class of the week we were taught about HTML images Syntax, such that the <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. The src attribute specifies the URL of the image. The second class of the week was much more hands on HTML, reinforcing the importance of semantic structure. From there we created a Òstarter fileÓ with all of the semantic tags preset so we could reference the file in the future, using it to code all of our future work. We were then able to put this all into practice as we worked on the solar system lab. A good potential exam question could be: what is the purpose of the href attribute?

Week 02
IST263

Weeks 02 of IST 263 had HTML as the main topic. Not just what HTML is and its mechanics, but what role it plays in making a webpage. HTML a general markup language, itÕs content that is rendered by a web browser. We went over the components such as tags, elements, attributes, and document type. Once we got through the general information, we looked at how to structure our HTML code and the guidelines to writing it properly to avoid errors. The most beneficial lesson of this week was walking through out to create the about-me.html page, then practicing how to use the tags 'html', 'head' ,'title', 'body' , and 'h1' and what they caused to output. Being able to walk through it with the professor, being able to ask questions first hand. I good question for an exam would be when it is appropriate to use blank lines and indentation.
